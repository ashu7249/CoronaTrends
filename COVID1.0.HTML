						 <dd><ul><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">The symptoms of infection for the new coronavirus are often similar to those of other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza. Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Most people will only have mild symptoms, but some can become very sick. When person-to-person spread has occurred with other novel coronaviruses that caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Spread of MERS and SARS has generally occurred between people in close contact.</li></ul></dd>
						 <dt>Keep things clean</dt>
						 <dd><ul><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li></dd>
						 <dt>Avoid close contact</dt>
						 <dd><ul><li style = "text-align:left;list-style-type:disc">The <abbr title = "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr> recommends maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others in public places since respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing do not travel more than 6 feet. While at home, remind everyone to practice everyday preventive actions – such as washing hands and wiping down surfaces – to help reduce the risk of getting sick. If you are symptomatic and have tested positive for COVID-19 but do not require hospitalization, you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your home as much as possible and use a separate bathroom, if available. If your living space makes it difficult to keep a 6-foot distance, stay as far apart as you can and continue to practice good hygiene and wear a mask.</li></ul></dd>
